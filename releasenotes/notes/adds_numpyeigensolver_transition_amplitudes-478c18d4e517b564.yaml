    Adds the public method :meth:`.NumpyEigensolver.compute_transition_amplitudes` to
    the :class:`.NumpyEigensolver`. This allows the user to specify auxiliary operators
    and pairs of eigenstates (k,l) to evaluate the associated transition amplitudes after 
    :meth:`.NumpyEigensolver.compute_eigenvalues` was called. See the docstring for an example
    of using the feature.
